## Lunar Test Designs

### Welcome!
Hey there and welcome to LunarTD (Lunar Test Designs)! This repo houses all of Our test design projects. These are web based versions of projects We work on, written in HTML, CSS and JS.

<br>  
 <br>  

### About
To make it easier for Visitors to find Our project test designs, We've put them all in one place. Easier to access and less hassle with navigating through repo's! We have many projects that are closed source but will be open sourced in the future. We thought that it'd be nice to give Visitors a "sneak peek" of what will be available in time. As the test designs represent what Our actual projects look like, this will give Visitors a hands on experience and will let Them decide if They like what They see and use.

> [!NOTE]
> - We use WebView applications for Android as they're lightweight and easy to use. This saves Us a lot of time having to develop a full-on application.
> - Whichever project We work on the most, will get the most test design updates.
> - We don't give ETA's on official project releases as there's multiple factors to consider such as Our Team, development or numerous things that could happen.

> - We ARE NOT responsible for how You use Our test designs.
> - We ARE NOT responsible for Your device or any issues that may occur after using anything We provide. Everything in this repo is open source but that doesn't mean that something can't or won't go wrong.
